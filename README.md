# PythonLab-1
The lab assignments for my CIS-30A Python Programming Class Lab 1
All of these are really simple, almost code snippits, and shouldn't
need much annotation other then their intro lines.  Some extra notes
were included for my professor to explain why I may have used something
we weren't offically taught yet.
